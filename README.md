=================

A simple modular implementation of [Conways Game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in Python 3.

Mathematical background for this work can be found at [following paper](http://www.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/sai/ws10/cpp/eca.pdf).

It's main purpose is exercise in the language. Anyhow I have a few more ideas what could be done:

 - expand with more states
 - add database interception
  - this could be vastly expanded to areas such as machine-learning
 - add some layer for representation, other than console-based output
